6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

The assignment operator has the following form: variable = expression
It assigns the value of the right expression to the variable on the left. It changes (if it had prior value) or initializes the value the variable.
The equal to operator has the following form: left_value == right_value
This operator checks if the two expressions are equal or not and produces a Boolean value of True if they are equal or False if they are not equal.
